# Grokking Coding Interview Patterns Progress

This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I work through the coding interview patterns from Educative. It contains:

- **Source Code**: Solutions to various coding problems and patterns.
- **Memlogs**: My personal notes and memorization logs to help reinforce my understanding of the patterns.

The goal of this repository is to document my learning process and provide a reference for future interviews. The problems covered will be common data structures and algorithms

Feel free to explore the code and notes as I continue to build my expertise!
