#+TITLE: Introduction to K-way Merge
The K-way Merge pattern is an algorithm for merging K sorted data structures (such as arrays or linked lists) into a single sorted structure. It is an extension of the merge sort algorithm.

** About the Pattern
- Merges K sorted lists into one sorted list.
- Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the K lists and adds it to the output list.
- The algorithm uses two main approaches: 
  - **Using a min heap**: 
    - Insert the first element of each list into a min heap.
    - Remove the smallest element from the heap, add it to the output list.
    - Replace the removed element with the next element from the same list.
    - Repeat until all elements are merged.
  - **Using grouping and merging pairs**: 
    - Divide lists into pairs, merge each pair using the standard two-way merge, then repeat.

** Example Schema for K-way Merge with Min Heap
- Input lists:
  #+BEGIN_SRC text
  [1, 3, 5]
  [2, 4, 6]
  [0, 7, 8]
  #+END_SRC

- Min Heap Process:
  1. Insert the first elements into the heap: [1, 2, 0]
  2. Remove the smallest element (0) and add to the output list.
  3. Replace 0 with the next element from the corresponding list: [1, 2, 3]
  4. Repeat steps until all elements are merged.

- Output list: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

** Example Schema for K-way Merge by Grouping
- Input lists:
  #+BEGIN_SRC text
  [1, 5, 9]
  [2, 6, 10]
  [3, 7, 11]
  #+END_SRC

- Group and Merge:
  1. Pair lists: [1, 5, 9] & [2, 6, 10]
  2. Merge each pair: [1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10]
  3. Repeat with remaining lists until one sorted list remains.

- Output list: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11]

** Real-world Applications
- **Patient Records Aggregation**: Merging sorted data streams from different sources (e.g., lab results, physician notes) into a unified chronological order for better diagnosis and treatment planning.
- **Merging Financial Transactions**: Combining sorted transaction data from multiple sources for real-time market analysis or fraud detection.
- **Log File Analysis**: Merging time-ordered logs from multiple servers for comprehensive analysis.

** Strategy Time!
- **Problem Match**: 
  - If the problem involves merging sorted arrays or finding the kth smallest/largest element across multiple sorted collections, then K-way merge is applicable.
  
** Example Problems:
1. Median of K sorted arrays: 
   - **Problem**: Find the median of K sorted arrays.
   - **Solution**: Merge all arrays into one sorted array and find the median.
  
2. Kth smallest element in K sorted arrays:
   - **Problem**: Find the kth smallest element.
   - **Solution**: Merge the arrays and return the element at position k.

** Does Your Problem Match This Pattern?
- **Yes**, if:
  - Involves merging sorted arrays or matrices.
  - Seeking the kth smallest or largest across sorted collections.
