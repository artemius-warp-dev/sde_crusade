#+TITLE: Sliding Window Pattern

** Overview
- **Sliding Window** is a technique used to process contiguous subsets (subarrays or substrings) of data in an array or string.
- Involves creating a dynamic window that "slides" across the data structure, adjusting boundaries as needed to process subsets.
- Efficient for solving problems where the window size may be **fixed** or **variable** and involves **constant time updates**.

** When to Use This Pattern
- Ideal for problems where:
  - Data is **contiguous** (e.g., arrays, strings).
  - You need repeated computations on subsets of elements.
  - You aim to maintain an **efficient time complexity** (O(1) or low time cost) when the window moves.

** Example Problems
1. **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**:
   - Problem: Given an integer array and an integer `k`, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `k`.
   - Approach: Sum elements within a window of size `k`, sliding the window to add new elements and remove old ones.

2. **Longest Substring without Repeating Characters**:
   - Problem: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.
   - Approach: Expand and contract the window to ensure no repeated characters, updating the maximum length as you go.

** Real-World Applications
1. **Telecommunications**:
   - Maximize the number of users connected to a base station within a **k-millisecond** sliding window.

2. **Video Streaming**:
   - Calculate the median buffering events over each **one-minute** interval to optimize the user experience.

3. **Social Media Analysis**:
   - Find the shortest sequence of posts by one user containing all topics of another user’s posts.

** Tips and Tricks
- **Hallway Analogy**: Imagine looking at paintings through a narrow frame in a long hallway. As you move the frame, new paintings enter the view while others leave—similar to sliding a window across data.
- **Efficient Update**: Instead of recalculating sums or counts, adjust only for the new data entering the window and the old data leaving it.

** Common Misapplications
- **Finding the kth Largest Element**: The sliding window approach is not ideal as it requires the entire array to be considered, rather than contiguous subarrays.
- **Noncontiguous Arrangements**: Problems like placing queens on a chessboard are best solved with other techniques like backtracking.

** Strategy Summary
- **Initialize**: Define the window size and set up pointers to track the boundaries of the subset.
- **Move**: Slide the window across the data, adjusting for elements that leave and enter the window.
- **Update**: Perform computations in constant or minimal time as the window moves, updating results as needed.
